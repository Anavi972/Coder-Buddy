### Planner Agent

Analyzes user requirements and creates a structured project plan.

### Architect Agent

Transforms the project plan into implementation tasks, defining files and development steps required for the final solution.

### Coder Agent

Executes implementation tasks, generates source code, and writes files using tool-calling workflows.
